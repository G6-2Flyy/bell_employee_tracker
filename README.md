# Employee Tracker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. Applications such as this create interfaces that allow non-developers to search, view, and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are referred to as content management systems (CMS). 

- This project was motivated by the desire to provide end-users, namely small business owners, with an application to view and manage departments, roles, and employees within his/her company.
- This application was designed to enhance business organizational effectiveness.
- This tool simplifies the way in which end users can view and interact with information stored in a database.
